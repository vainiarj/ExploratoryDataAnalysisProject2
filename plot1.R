## 1.Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
## Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission  
## from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

## aggregate the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 
aggTotals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,NEI, sum)
